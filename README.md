# Miweoro's Website But Open-Source (MWBOS)
NOTE: not all of pages will show up here
Basically I used dell's npm package named hexagonal.js to rewrite the whole website and depend the WHOLE website on a open-source typescript file
## Building
First download the ZIP and extract it.
You basically only need to download those packages in the project folder:
- typescript (globally)
- rollup (globally)
- @rollup/plugin-node-resolve (rollup plugin)
- tsloader (globally)
- hexagonal.js (`npm install hexagonal.js`)
Then drag the html file over the dist folder.
And then just have fun with the site!
## Installation
If you dont wanna build just use the built-in folder inside the releases.
## Updating
Just update hexagonal.js by typing `npm install hexagonal.js`
