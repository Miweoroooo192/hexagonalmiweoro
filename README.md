# Miweoro's Website Hexagonal Rewrite
Basically I used dell's npm package named hexagonal.js to rewrite the whole website and depend the WHOLE website on a open-source typescript file
## Building
First download the ZIP and extract it.
You basically only need to download those packages in the project folder:
- typescript (`npm install typescript -g`)
- rollup (`npm install rollup -g`)
- @rollup/plugin-node-resolve (rollup plugin)
- tsloader (`npm install tsloader -g`)
- hexagonal.js (`npm install hexagonal.js`)
Then drag the html file over the dist folder.
And then just have fun with the site!
