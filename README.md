# Miweoro's Website But Open-Source (MWBOS)
NOTE: not all of pages will show up here
Basically I used dell's npm package named hexagonal.js to rewrite the whole website and depend the WHOLE website on a open-source typescript file
## Building
First download the ZIP and extract it;

You basically only need to type down  `npm i`;

Compile the code using `npx rollup -c`;

Then drag the built-in html file over the dist folder;

And then just have fun with the site!
## Installation
If you dont wanna build just use the built-in folder inside the releases.
## Updating
Just update hexagonal.js by typing `npm install hexagonal.js`
